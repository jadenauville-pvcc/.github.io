<tr><td colspan="4"><ul>
    <h1> Network Classifications </h1>

    <h2>  </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>LAN: LAN is a Local Area Network that normally consists of a collection of computers in a single building or building complex.</li>
        <li>MAN: MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) is a network of intermediate size, such as one spanning a local community.</li>
        <li>WAN: A WAN (Wide Area Network) links machines over a greater distance-perhaps in neighboring cities or on opposite sides of the world.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Network models</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>bus network:</li>
        <li>star network</li>        
    </ul>
    <h1>Protocols</h1>
    <ul>    
    <li>CSMA/CD Ethernet: This protocol dictates that each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus.</li>
    <li>CSMA/CA WiFi: </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Combining networks</h1>
    <ul>    
    <li>Repeater: The Repeater  is little more than a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses without considering the meaning of the signals.</li>
    <li>Bridge: A Bridge, like a repeater, connects two buses, but it does not necessarily pass all messages across the connection. Instead, it looks at the destination address that accompanies each message and forwards a message across the connection only when that message is destined for a computer on the other side.</li>
    <li>Switch: A Switch is essentially a bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to connect several buses rather than just two.</li>
    <li>Router: Routers are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.</li>
    <li>Gateway: The "point" at which one network is linked to an internet is often called a Gateway because it serves as a passageway between the network and the outside world.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Client/server model</h1>
    <ul>    
    <li>p2p: peer-to-peer: p2p is when the client/server model involves one process providing a service to numerous others, the peer-to-peer model involves processes that provide service to and receive service from each other.</li>
    <li>Distributed system: Distributed systems consist of software units that execute as processes on different computers.</li>
    <li>Cloud computing: Cloud computing is where huge pools of shared computers on the network can be allocated for use by clients as needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Internet Addressing</h1>
    <ul>    
    <li>Tier 1: Tier 1 consists of very high-speed, high-capacity, international WANs.</li>
    <li>Tier 2: Tier 2 ISPs tend to be more regional in scope and less potent in their capabilities.</li>
    <li>Tier 3: Tier 3 is an independent Internet, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a single authority that is in the buisness of supplying Internet access to individual homes and businesses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>IP address</h1>
    <ul>    
    <li><a href="https://www.icann.org/"> ICANN is a nonprofit corporation established to coordinate the Internet's operation.</a></li>
    <li>DNS: The DNS (Domain Name System) is name servers that are used as an Internet-wide directory system.</li>
    <li>TLD (Top-level domain): A TLD is used to reflect the domain's classification.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.worldstandards.eu/other/tlds/">TLDs: Country-code TLDs are TLDs that were added to include countries all over the world.</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Internet protocols</h1>
    <ul>    
    <li>FTP: The FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a stnadard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network.</li>
    <li>HTTP: HTTP is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.</li>
    <li>SMTP: SMTP is an Internet standard communication protocol for electronic mail transmission. Mail servers and other message transfer agents use SMTP to send and receive mail messages.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1>World Wide Web</h1>
    <ul>    
    <li>URL: A URL is a reference to a resourse that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.</li>
    <li>Client-side activities: Client-side activities refers to everything in a web application that is displayed or takes place on the client (end user device)</li>
    <li>Server-side activities: Server-side activities is everything that happens on the server, instead of on the client.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Internet four-layer software</h1>
    <ul>    
    <li>Application layer: An application layer is an abstraction layer that specifies the shared communication protocols and interface methods used by hosts in a communications network.</li>
    <li>Transport layer: The transport layer is a conceptual division of methods in the layered architecture of protocols in the network stack in the Internet protocol suite and the OSI model.</li>
    <li>Network layer: The network layer is responsible for packet forwarding including routing through intermediate routers.</li>
    <li>Link layer: The link layer is the group of methods and communications protocols confined to the link that a host is physically connected to.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Internet is:</h1>
    <ul>    
    <li>Packet-switching network: Packet switching is a method of grouping data into packets that are transmitted over a digital network.</li>
    <li>Fault tolerant: Faulr tolerance is the ability of a system to maintain proper operation in the even of failures or faults in one or more of its components.</li>
    <li>Redundant: is when a network arrangement with several links and paths between the person who places a call and the call recipient.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Cybersecurity</h1>
    <ul>    
    <li>Malware: Malware is any software intentionally designed to cause disruption to a computer, server, client, or computer network, leak private information, gain unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive access to information, or which unknowingly interferes with the user's computer security and privacy.</li>
    <li>Virus: A Virus is software that infects a computer by inserting itself into programs that already reside in the machine.</li>
    <li>Worm: A Worm is an autonomous program that transfers itself through a network, taking up residence in computers and forwarding copies of itself to other computers.</li>
    <li>Trojan horse: A Trojan horse is a program that enters a computer system disguised as a desirable program.</li>
    <li>Spyware: Spyware is software that collects information about activities at the computer on which it resides and reports that information back to the instigator of the attack.</li>
    <li>Phishing: Phishing is a technique of obtaining information explicitly by simply asking for it.</li>
    <li>DDoS attack: When the work of generating DoS attacks is distributed over many hosts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Protection</h1>
    <ul>    
    <li>Firewall: A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.</li>
    <li>Spam filter: Spam filters are firewalls designed to block unwanted email.</li>
    <li>Proxy filter: A proxy server is a software unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of the server.</li>
    <li>Antivirus software: Antivirus software is used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections.</li>
    <li>Cryptography: Cryptography is the study of sending and receiving messages securely in the presence of adversaries.</li>
    <li>Public key encryption: A public key encryption system involves the use of two keys. One key, known as the public key, is used to encrypt messages; the other key, known as the private key, is required to decrypt messages.</li>
    </ul>
