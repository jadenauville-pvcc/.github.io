    </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Compiler</h1>
    <ul>    
    <li>Compiles several machine instructions into short sequences to simulate the activity requested by a single high-level primitive.
    </li>

    <h1>Interpreter</h1>
    <ul>    
    <li>An alternative to translators, emerged as another means of implementing third-generation languages.

    </ul>

    <h1>Cross-platform Software	</h1>
    <ul>    
    <li>Software that is independent of an operating system's design as well as the machine's hardware design and is therefore executabl throughout a network.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Natural Language	</h1>
    <ul>    
    <li>Languages such as English, Spanish, and French.

    </ul>

    <h1>High-Level Programming Language	</h1>
    <ul>    
    <li>Provides more abstractions for the programmer and make it easier for people to read and write a program.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)	</h1>
    <ul>    
    <li>Software system is viewed as collection of units, called objects, each of which is capable of performing the actions that are immediately related to itself as well as requesting actions of other objects.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Scripted Language	</h1>
    <ul>    
    <li>Languages used to perform administrative tasks rather than to develop complex programs.    </li>

    <h1>Data Types	
    </h1>
    <ul>    
    <li>Integer: Refers to numeric data consisting of whole numbers.</li>
    <li>Float: Refers to numeric data that might contain values other than whole numbers, probably stored in floating-point notation.
    </li>
    <li>String: A data type used in programming, that is used to represent text rather than numbers.
</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Primitive Data Type	</h1>

    <li>Tuple: Used to store multiple items in a single variable, ordered and unchangeable. Written with round brackets.</li>
    <li>Set: Used to store multiple items in a single variable. It is unordered, unchangeable, and unindexed. Written with curly brackets.
    </li>
    <li>Dictionary: Used to store data values in key:value pairs. It is ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates. Written with curly brackets, and have keys and values.
    </li>
